## Front End Developer Challenge

We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
* Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images 
* Display descriptive data for each image
* Like an image
* Unlike an image


## Framework choice

As a front end developer, I like to use React.js to build the project. React.js allows me to easily translate these components into code, and then, individually make them responsive, reusable and accessible
